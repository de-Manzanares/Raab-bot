### Build from source

Because Raab-bot üê∞ is a UCI chess engine, it's pretty much useless without a
GUI.
Personally, I'd recommend [SCID vs. PC](https://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/).

#### Prerequisites

CMake version 3.20 or greater and GCC or MSVC CL
(I can't figure out how to get along with clang).

There is a sprinkling of C++20 language features, so if your compiler isn't
puttin' up with it, get a newer version!
To see if your package manager has one (for Ubuntu-style systems at least)
try ```apt search g++```.

#### Linux

The easiest way to build the latest version is as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/de-Manzanares/Raab-bot.git
cd Raab-bot
git checkout $(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)
./build.sh
```

#### Windows and Mac ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

CMake is supposed to be cross-platform, right? I'm sure you can figure it out.

The GitHub workflows in the [Status](#Status) section verify whether this
project can be built on Windows and/or Mac.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to the contributors of [Lila](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila)
(aka Lichess),
the coolest online chess platform!

Thank you to the contributors
of [lichess-bot](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot).
There's no way I could have figured out the Lichess API on my own.
Come to think of it, I'm not sure what API stands for...

Most of all, a huge thank you to my CS professors and the CS department as a
whole.
Your well-structured courses and welcoming community sparked a deep
interest in C++.

Thank you! üôè
